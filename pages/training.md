<h3>Coastal Engineering</h3>
<p>An introductory course covering the fundamental principles of coastal engineering. Topics include basic wave theory (wave generation, analysis, refraction, diffraction shoaling and breaking), wave prediction techniques, tides, coastal circulations and sediment transport. The latter portion of the course is devoted to the application of these basic principles to coastal structure and shore protection design.</p>

<h3>Coastal Geology</h3>
<p>An introductory course presenting a geological framework, distinguishing among types of coasts, the forces sculpting the land, and the sediments accumulating in distinct forms.  This module will touch on special disciplines of coastal geomorphology, sedimentology and coastal processes.</p>

<h3>Coastal Resiliency</h3>
<p>An introductory course will present the concepts of coastal resiliency and how to increase the resiliency of your shoreline.  Participants will be given an understanding of coastal resilience concepts, methods to increase resiliency, and tools available to estimate and measure coastal resilience.  The basis for the module is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ research on improving coastal resiliency.</p>

<h3>Coastal Ecology/Biology</h3>
<p>An interception course will present the basic concepts of coastal ecology/ecology.  The course will provide up-to-date science-based and skill-building opportunities to professionals whose work is affected by coastal resources. The spatial zone of interest is a relatively narrow portion of the continental shelf/coastal plain where land and sea meet. Basic concepts will encompass major biological constituents that make up the dynamic and diverse set of ecosystems and species including the open ocean, barrier islands, coastal marsh, estuarine resources and threatened and endangered species.</p>

<h3>Planning and Land Use</h3>
<p>An introductory course will present the basic concepts of planning and land use.  The course will highlight how activities in adjacent upland can affect the coastal zone, via land use, planning, jurisdictions, regulations, habitat impacts, property rights and more. This section also looks at the upland aspects of coastal resilience and disaster planning and recovery, as well as resolving conflicts between political boundaries and littoral zones and addressing the impacts and issues surrounding seal level change.</p>

<h3>Communications</h3>
<p>An introductory course will present the basic concepts of effective communications.  This course provides participants an understanding of communication goals, stakeholders and audiences, delivery and tools.  It also provides hands-on examples of how to effectively communicate with a variety of media,  peers, and government agencies.  A highly interactive session, this will feature problem-solving drawing on participants’ own experiences.</p>

<h3>Government Operations</h3>
<p>An introductory course will present basic concepts in government operations.  The course will review the structure of federal and state government and how they work, including how authorities are granted, the federal budget process, and basic regulatory programs.  The local and federal government structure and the budgeting process will be discussed.  Additionally, the module will present the best way to effectively communicate your message to elected officials so you can advance your project through the bureaucratic maze.</p> 

<h3>Project Management</h3>
<p>An introductory course will present basic concepts of project management.  The course will discuss the tools that a project manager needs to effectively perform his/her job.  This module will gain a greater appreciation for the diverse expertise in a wide variety of areas required to make up an effective project team, and to enable the manger to more efficiently coordinate activities among the various specialists to facilitate a well-integrated effort that will expedite completion of what are often large and complicated projects.</p>

<h3>Government Affairs</h3>
<p>This introductory course will focus on the operational side of governments: Getting bills (both authorizations and appropriations) through Congress, understanding and working with the federal agencies most engaged in the coast (as well as an explanation of their various roles in coastal management), and the integral involvement of state and local governments in coastal management and engaging with the federal government.</p>

<h3>Coastal Zone Management and Coastal Regulations</h3>
<p>An introductory course will present the concepts of coastal zone management and coastal regulation.  Understanding the reason for coastal zone management and how to ensure that your project meets the guidelines.  The module also discusses the interaction between the coastal zone management regulations and the coastal state and federal regulations.  These concepts are present though a review of a sample project that takes the participant through coastal zone management and regulatory process.</p>
